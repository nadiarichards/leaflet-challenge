# leaflet-challenge
JavaScript data visualization challenge using Leaflet library.

This map is visualizng worldwide data on earthquakes that took place in the past last 7 days. 
For mapping the earthquakes on the map of the world I have used [Mapbox API](https://www.mapbox.com/). And for earthquake data I have used GeoJSON from [USGS (United States Geological Survey)](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).

The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color. Tooltips are activated on mouseover showing data on a specific location and magnitude of the earthqake as well as its depth.

Please see the link to my code [here.](https://github.com/nadiarichards/leaflet-challenge/blob/main/Leaflet-Step-1/static/js/logic.js)
